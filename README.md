# Pi Day
The 14th of March (3/14) is the Pi-Day, this repo celebrates this day by gathering GPU accelerated algorithms to compute pi.

## Monte Carlo GPU
[Monte Carlo GPU](monte_carlo) features a heavily parallelized Monte Carlo algorithm to compute pi.
6 valid decimals are obtained around 10 seconds of computing by shooting no more than 40 billions random particles.
